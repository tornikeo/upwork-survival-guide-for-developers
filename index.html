        <h3>Appropriate proposal</h3>
        <p>Hey. I've worked as a full-stack ML engineer for projects like serverless stable diffusion <a href="https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/serverless_diffusion/">https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/serverless_diffusion/</a> and web-based pose estimation <a href="https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/pose_estim/">https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/pose_estim/</a>. Can create working products given just business objectives and funding.</p>
        <p>Let's have a meeting to see if I'm the right fit for this,</p>
        <p>All the best,</p>
        <p>TornikeO</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Links to your work</strong> are the <strong>single most importnt</strong> thing to get the client to sit down.</p>
        <p><strong>Be quick</strong>! a client gets lots of offers, they only have time to read the first 10 words or so.</p>
        <p><strong>Always</strong> suggest to "have a quick meeting" in the <strong>end</strong> - if client is interested, that's the first most likely thing to do, either way.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p><mark>542 hours, $30,500.00 earned</mark></p>
        Notes:
          <ul>
            <li>During initial meeting I walked the interviewer through applications I developed for showcase, and some past projects that had flashy visuals (interviewers are rarely tech people, so visuals are a <strong>must</strong>)</li>
            <li>Work actually never required a 40 hours full-time commitment</li>
            <li>Work didn't actually require an expert - they just needed provable experience (which just means <strong>having links to your work</strong>).</li>
            <li>First project was closely related to "stable diffusion". The client wanted an SD GUI built on <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">SDUI</a></li>
            <li>Later projects ranged from writing CUDA kernels for metabolomics to making a robot brain for automatic nanomaterial assembly. Wild stuff!</li>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Links to your work</strong> - in this case, I applied for this job, because I had a very similar project already done.</p>
        <p><strong>Be quick</strong> - Begin with "Here's my <em>XYZ</em> showcase project that I did. It's very similar!". If your project is even vaguely related to the posting, you will most likely get an offer</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p><mark>34 hours, $1,776.25 earned</mark></p>
        Notes:
          <ul>
            <li>Initial meeting was the client showing me their project and me nitpicking it - turns out, having even one project done in a similar field as the posting will give useful insights that you can then share!</li>
            <li>I believe my English pronounciation and not having a strong accent definitely helped. People get annoyed easily when you don't speak straight.</li>
