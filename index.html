        <h3>Appropriate proposal</h3>
        <p>Hey. I've worked as a full-stack ML engineer for projects like serverless stable diffusion <a
            href="https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/serverless_diffusion/">https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/serverless_diffusion/</a>
          and web-based pose estimation <a
            href="https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/pose_estim/">https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/pose_estim/</a>.
          Can create working products given just business objectives and funding.</p>
        <p>Let's have a meeting to see if I'm the right fit for this,</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Links to your work</strong> are the <strong>single most importnt</strong> thing to get the client to
          sit down.</p>
        <p><strong>Be quick</strong>! a client gets lots of offers, they only have time to read the first 10 words or
          so.</p>
        <p><strong>Always</strong> suggest to "have a quick meeting" in the <strong>end</strong> - if client is
          interested, that's the first most likely thing to do, either way.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p><mark>542 hours, $30,500.00 earned</mark></p>
        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>During initial meeting I walked the interviewer through applications I developed for showcase, and some
            past projects that had flashy visuals (interviewers are rarely tech people, so visuals are a
            <strong>must</strong>)</li>
          <li>Work actually never required a 40 hours full-time commitment</li>
          <li>Work didn't actually require an expert - they just needed provable experience (which just means
            <strong>having links to your work</strong>).</li>
          <li>First project was closely related to "stable diffusion". The client wanted an SD GUI built on <a
              href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">SDUI</a></li>
          <li>Later projects ranged from writing CUDA kernels for metabolomics to making a robot brain for automatic
            nanomaterial assembly. Wild stuff!</li>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Links to your work</strong> - in this case, I applied for this job, because I had a very similar
          project already done.</p>
        <p><strong>Be quick</strong> - Begin with "Here's my <em>XYZ</em> showcase project that I did. It's very
          similar!". If your project is even vaguely related to the posting, you will most likely get an offer</p>

        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>Initial meeting was the client showing me their project and me nitpicking it - turns out, having even one
            project done in a similar field as the posting will give useful insights that you can then share!</li>
          <li>I believe my English pronounciation and not having a strong accent definitely helped. People get annoyed
            easily when you don't speak straight.</li>

        <h3>Appropriate proposal</h3>
        <p>Hey. I've hacked together this LangChain pdf summarizer in one evening (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koCmHr7V0MI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koCmHr7V0MI</a>). I've also worked extensively with StableDiffusion+LoRa tuning for Dreambooth personalization (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdUAaRagIjQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdUAaRagIjQ</a>). My full portfolio is hosted here: <a href="https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/">https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/</a></p>


        <p>I think we should start with a quick chat. Also, a few more details about the "testing" chatbot would be nice.</p>


        <p>All the best,</p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>Read the job, find a past project (even a hobby project will do), and link it. Even the simple stuff works wonderfully!</p>
        <p>If you don't have a past related project, try to get one done by yourself. It will win you a lot of money in the end.</p>

        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>First meeting was a competition. Client hired 3 freelancers (me including) and all of us made a sample chatbot (everything UI + brains). </li> 
          <li>Personally, I believe others' UIs looked cleaner. But, I additionally provided some thorough explanations (especially the <strong>shortcomings</strong>!)</li>
          <li>I think the explanations are what got me this job - other guys didn't explain details, I did, so I believe this led the client to choose me in the end.</li>
